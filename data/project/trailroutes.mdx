## Graphs and interactivity

This was a perfect opportunity to get into [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) while building an interactive graph where you can track the elevation change and see where it is on the map.

  <Video src="/projects/trailroutes/graph.mp4"></Video>

## Trail routes for iOS

Built a small iOS app with SwiftUI and made an overkill launch video.

<div>
  <Video src="/projects/trailroutes/app.mp4" autoPlay={false}></Video>
</div>
