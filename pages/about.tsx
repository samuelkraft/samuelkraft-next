              Currently working at{" "}
              <Link href="https://bitrefill.com">Bitrefill</Link>, making living
              on crypto possible. Before that I worked at music startup{" "}

              I love working in the realm between design and code. Some things
              that makes me excited are CSS, Design Systems, Animation, crafting
              excellent component apis and making interfaces feel fun and human.
            </p>
            <p>
              I grew up in Nacka just outside of Stockholm, Sweden and come from
              a background of studying Photography.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of work I’m obsessed with endurance sports and travelling
              with my family.
