The design system consists of resources to create a consistent design experience across all products. There's no right or wrong way to approach a new design, but we recommend using Playroom to quickly build out new designs, this way you can quickly build UI with actual code to handoff to developers.

## What is Playroom?

[Playroom](https://design-system-starter.vercel.app)(Coming soon) is a browser-based playground where you can quickly iterate and test new designs. It's a great way to get started with new design concepts using our desing system in code.

## Figma

We also supply a [Figma](https://www.figma.com) file for each design system component.
